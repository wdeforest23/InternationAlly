      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Modern apartment building:** Built within the last 10 years, offering modern amenities and finishes.\n",
      "* **Competitive rent:** At $2,000 per month, it falls within the average rent range for one-bedroom apartments in Chicago.\n",

      "\n",
